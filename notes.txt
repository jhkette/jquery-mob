Look at how to do use cases. 

One page widget in external page on each individual single html file 
. CSS needs to be on bothpages. 

Every page will have pageone.css and pageone.js in the head. 

Navbar is better - than fixed toolbar - could use symbols. 


You could use list view as a panel !important - this is a good idea. 
List View is in a panel


For navpanel ie hamburger menu you will need different id each time.
The div has an id and the a href links to the id. Can't use the same id
on different pages. Name id and then name of page. 

<div data-role="page" id="first" data-theme="a">
<div data-role="panel" id="navpanel"> <!-- panel content goes here -->
</div>
.....
</div>

<a href="#navpanel" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all Ã  ui-icon-bars ui-btn-icon-notext"></a>

ie the navpanel needs to be id='navpanal-page-one'.

// dont' mess around with width and height of panel too much.
